            <p>
              Hello, my name is Leland. Thank you very much for taking the time
              to view my portfolio. I am an aspiring software engineer presently
              midway through a software engineering program with Thinkful.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was born and raised in Nebraska. I currently work as a Police
              Sergeant in Portland, Oregon. I have worked in law enforcement for
              ten years with a demonstrated history of developing and
              implementing solutions to complex problems, collaboration with
              stakeholders from a wide variety of backgrounds, and meeting
              demanding expectations with minimal supervision.
            </p>

      <!-- About Me -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2 class="group">about me</h2>
        <div class="group">
          <div class="item">
            <p>
              I attended college at the University of Nebraska-Omaha. I was
              awarded both a regent's scholarship and the prestigious Walter
              Scott, Jr. scholarship. After studying computer science for about
              two years I decided to pursue other interests. I became a police
              officer to help people in need. I have worked as a police officer
              and sergeant for a combined ten years. I hope to apply many of the
              transferable skills I have learned to a new career as a software
              developer, including communication, teamwork, and critical
              analysis.
            </p>
            <p>
              Perhaps the most valuable things in any job are the people with
              whom one works. In my job search, I hope to find a team of
              excellent programmers as enthusiastic about coding as myself, with
              great senses of humor, and a strong work ethic. While working
              through the curriculum of the software engineering program in
              which I am enrolled I have monitored a Discord and Slack server of
              my peers. I actively look to help others with their problems when
              they arise because it reinforces my skills and builds a
              positive cultural norm around mutual support. When I arrive at a
              problem I strive to test my abilities and solve it myself. When I
              have exhausted my resources I craft a question as specifically as
              possible about the issue I'm facing and note the efforts I've
              already made.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am passionate about technology and problem-solving. It is
              immensely satisfying to me when I can craft a piece of code that
              performs a useful task or take a broken piece of code and make it
              work. As I work through my Bootcamp curriculum I am continually
              noticing and admiring how different websites and apps interact
              with users. I look forward to developing such solutions myself and
              continuing my lifelong journey of learning in software
              development. Here are some of the languages, frameworks, skills,
              and concepts I have studied:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>JavaScript ES6</li>
              <li>React.js</li>
              <li>HTML 5</li>
              <li>CSS 3</li>
              <li>Node.js</li>
              <li>Express</li>
              <li>PostgreSQL</li>
              <li>GitHub</li>
              <li>Agile Methodology (CSM Certification)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I compliment those skills with my leadership, communication, and
              problem-solving abilities developed over my ten years in law
              enforcement.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding I love to be outdoors or out on the town. I'm
              into hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, architecture, art, and
              theatre.
